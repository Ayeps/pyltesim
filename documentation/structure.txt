This is a text file detailing the structure of the network simulator.

== General ==
The 'simulator' generally consists of scripts that do all the action (load files, manage repetitions, logging, world creation and execution, results storage). For example, see scripts/RAPSmulticell.py.

Unit tests are located inside the module folders. testsuite.py collects all tests. Tests have been reasonably well maintained.

= Folders =
== configure ==
Configuration files
== documentation ==
This file
== fsf ==
Frequency selective fading generation
== iwf ==
Inverse Water-filling (or Margin Adaptation)
== optim ==
All calls to the ipopt library
== out ==
Default output folder for simulation data, logging, etc.
== plotting ==
Anything that calls matplotlib
== quantmap ==
Quantization for raps. Should probably better be in raps
== raps ==
Resource Allocation using Power Control and Sleep as well as the its benchmarks
== rcg ==
Rate-craving greedy. Move to raps?
== results ==
Results handlers, data collectors
== scripts ==
Scripts to be called from the shell
== utils ==
Static functions (e.g. dB conversion, etc.)
== world ==
All world elements. Tried to keep world generation apart from other simulation parts.

= Getting started =
1. Check configuration in config/settingsRAPSmulticell.cfg
2. Call script, e.g. 'python scripts/RAPSmulticell.py'
3. Follow std out

Important simulator objects
===================================================================

== World ==
The world is the master container. It contains physical or spatial objects (e.g. base
stations, mobiles, hexagons, grids). It performs some actions like distributing
these. The world needs to consist of at least one hexagon (tier 0). 

World receives configuration object, one for the physical layer and one for world parameters.

== Base stations ==
When a base station has 1 sector, it is in the center of a hexagon. When it
serves three sectors (default), then it is on the edge of three hexagons. The
first BS is placed on the north vertex of the central hexagon. Note the
important difference between a hexagon and a BS. The map is created in the
following way. 1. Place hexagons. 2. Place BS to cover the hexagons.

A BS is a site. It has a position, a power consumption and a set of cells that are responsible for the actual transmission.

== Cell ==
A cell is mainly a directional antenna. It has transmission power and mobiles are connected to it. 

== Mobile ==
Mobiles have a position and all fading information. Since we simulate the downlink, the fading information at the mobile determines rates, scheduling, etc.
