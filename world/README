This folder contains the world module which puts together a hexagonally arranged map of base stations and distributes mobiles on it. I also played around with pre-computing the world map and reusing a map exactly to have comparable and repeatable results. But I never got around to fully separating those parameters affect the world, wconfig, and those that are modified specifically.
